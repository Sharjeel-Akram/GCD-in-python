# Write Python function GCD(n, m) where n â‰¥ m. 
# Relatively prime integers are the integers whose GCD is 1. Using the GCD(n,m) function as the 
# building block, write a function rel_prime(n) which will compute the probability that two 
# randomly chosen integers lesser than a given integer n will be relatively prime. User will call this 
# function and pass the input.

#Code for GCD

    if n % m == 0:

    else:
        return gcd(m,n%m)
