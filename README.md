# GCD-in-python

Write Python function GCD(n, m) where n â‰¥ m. 

- Relatively prime integers are the integers whose GCD is 1. Using the GCD(n,m) function as the building block, write a function rel_prime(n) which will compute the probability that two randomly chosen integers lesser than a given integer n will be relatively prime. User will call this function and pass the input.
